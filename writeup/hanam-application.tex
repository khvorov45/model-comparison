This section shows an application of the scaled logit model to the Ha Nam cohort which is plotted in Figure \ref{HanamCounts}. For this cohort, the Cox model is not suitable due to absence of reliable data on disease activity. The standard logistic model is inappropriate due to unjustified assumption of baseline of 1.
