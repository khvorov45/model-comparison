The scaled logit model was applied to both the Kiddivax and the Ha Nam data.

The resulting protection curve for Kiddivax is in Figure \ref{fig:kiddyvaxmain-prot-sclr} and for Ha Nam --- in Figure \ref{fig:hanam-prot-sclr}.

Out of the three models, the scaled logit model appears to be most appropriate.
The Kiddivax data did not have enough information to produce useful estimates.
