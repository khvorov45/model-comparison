We discuss all 3 models in the context of a binary outcome $Y$ representing the infection status where 0 --- not infected, 1 --- infected, and a continuous covariate $X$ representing the log-titre measurement.

The fitting of all models was done using the standard maximum likelihood framework. All observations with missing values were removed. All censored titre observation were handled as follows: below-detectable values were set to half of the lowest detectable level (e.g., when the lowest detectable level is 10, the below-detectable values were st to 5), above-detectable values were set to the highest dilution used, the other values were set to the geometric mean of the corresponding interval, e.g. a value of 20 was shifted to the geometric mean of 20 and 40.
