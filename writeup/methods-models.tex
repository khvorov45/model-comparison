We will discuss all 3 models in the context of a binary outcome $Y$ representing the infection status where 0 --- not infected, 1 --- infected, and a continuous covariate $X$ representing the log-titre measurement. 

The fitting of all models will be done using the standard maximum likelihood framework. All observations with missing values will be removed. All censored titre observation will be handled as follows: below-detectable values will be set to half of the lowest detectable level (e.g., when the lowest detectable level is 10, the below-detectable values are "imputed" as 5), above-detectable values will be set to the highest dilution used, the other values will be set to the geometric mean of the corresponding interval, e.g. a value of 20 would be shifted to the geometric mean of 20 and 40.
