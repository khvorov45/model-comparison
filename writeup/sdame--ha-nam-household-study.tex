%Antibody titres induced by vaccination may reach neither the concentration nor the breadth of antibodies induced by natural infection. Thus, the median titre indicative of protection post-vaccination may differ from the protective titre induced by prior infection among unvaccinated individuals. 
The Ha Nam study has followed 270 households in Ha Nam Vietnam since 2007. We direct the reader to \cite{Horby;2012} for full description of the study but provide a brief outline here.

Sera are collected (bi)annually, at intervals spanning RT-PCR-confirmed transmission periods, determined by surveillance data. Households are followed weekly for influenza-like illness and all household members swabbed when any member shows symptoms. Unlike the Kiddivax study, where the time at risk can be measured, in the Ha Nam study and other household studies of natural infection, the true time at risk is unknown. These differences are depicted in Figure \ref{Studies}.

We will be using study data from 2009 to 2015 consisting of the subjects' pre-season HI titre measurements against H1N1pdm09 and H3N2 viruses as well as the subjects' infection status with those viruses.
