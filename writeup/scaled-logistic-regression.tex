The scaled logit model is the same as logistic regression except that it estimates the baseline probability of outcome (i.e., the probability at low covariate values assuming a protective covariate) as opposed to assuming that it is equal to 1 \cite{Dunning;2006}. If there is only one covariate which is the antibody titre measurement then the model is

\begin{align*}
\begin{gathered}
P(Y=1) = \frac{\lambda}{1 + \text{exp}(\beta_0 + \beta_X X)}
\end{gathered}
\end{align*}

Note that with the above parameterisation, the $\beta_0$ and $\beta_X$ parameters are negated relative to logistic regression. The new parameter $\lambda$ is the baseline risk, $\text{exp}(\beta_0)$ is the reduction in the baseline risk (protection) at $X=0$, $\beta_X$ is the ratio of protection of subjects with a given $X$ compared to subjects whose $X$ is 1 unit lower.
