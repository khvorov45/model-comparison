The Cox PH model was applied to the Kiddivax data. Subjects were tracked from the start of follow-up to either infection (if they were infected) or end of follow-up (if they were not infected). This analysis assumed that all subjects were followed through a period of similar disease activity and were similarly exposed. The resulting protection curve (relative to the titre of 5) is in Figure \ref{fig:kiddyvaxmain-cox}.
