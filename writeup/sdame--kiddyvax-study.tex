The Kiddivax study was a randomized controlled trial undertaken in Hong Kong in 2009-2010 in which 796 children aged 6-17 years were randomized to receive inactivated vaccine. Blood samples were taken pre and 1 month post-vaccination to estimate their vaccine-induced antibody titres.  The children and their household contacts were followed for about 7 months for signs of influenza-like illness. Symptoms reported by any household member prompted swabbing and influenza testing by PCR for all household members \citep{Cowling;2013}. The protective titre could be estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model where the outcome was time to infection or the end of the study \citep{Ng;2013}.
