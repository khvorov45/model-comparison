    \begin{tabular}{cp{25em}}
    \toprule
    Model & Investigated through simulation \\
    \midrule
    Cox PH & Impact of time at risk being not being equal to time of follow-up but proportional to it. Impact of heterogeneity of time at risk. Impact of Time at risk not being proportional for everyone due to a proportion of the sample having earlier follow-up start. \\
    Logistic & Impact of baseline infection probability being below 1. \\
    Scaled logit & Impact of sample size and the proportion of the sample exposed to the pathogen. \\
