The logistic model assumes that the probability of outcome follows a logistic curve from 1 (at low covariate values assuming a protective covariate) to 0 (at high covariate values). If there is only one covariate which is the antibody titre measurement, then the model is:

\begin{align*}
\begin{gathered}
P(Y=1) = \frac{\text{exp}(\beta_0 + \beta_X X)}{1 + \text{exp}(\beta_0 + \beta_X X)}
\end{gathered}
\end{align*}

Where $\beta_0$ is the log-odds of infection when $X=0$ and $\beta_X$ is the log-odds ratio of infection of subjects with a given $X$ compared to subjects subjects whose $X$ is 1 unit lower.
