In the context of infection data, a problem for applying the Cox PH model is that it assumes that $t$ is time-at-risk. True time at risk would be the time the subjects were exposed to the pathogen. This time usually cannot be measured and hence time-at-risk is unobservable.

To illustrate why the inablility to observe true time-at-risk may be a problem, consider Figure \ref{CoxExampleFull} which shows two subjects who are followed until both get infected.

\begin{figure}[htp]

	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{../curve-cox/timeplot_1_light.pdf}
	\caption{
	An example of time-to-event data. Two subjects are followed from time 0. Subject 1 experiences the even at time 100. Subject 2 experiences the event at time 150.
	}
	\label{CoxExampleFull}
\end{figure}

Since subject 2 got infected later (i.e., ``survived'' for longer), the covariate pattern (e.g., antibody titre) of subject 2 would be considered by the model to be more ``protective'' than that of subject 1. That is, their covariates would be consistent with a reduced hazard. Since we assume that at most one infection is possible for any subject, both subjects are no longer at risk after the event. For subject 1, $t=100,\ Y=1$. For subject 2, $t=150,\ Y=1$. For any subject who does not get infected, $t$ would be their total follow-up time and $Y=0$.

If subjects are not at risk for all of their follow-up time (e.g., not exposed to the virus), then the total follow-up time may be misleading as illustrated in Figure \ref{CoxExamplePartial}. Taking the actual time at risk into account would lead to the opposite conclusion in this example --- it is subject 1 who is more ``protected'' since they were at risk for longer.

\begin{figure}[htp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{../curve-cox/timeplot_2_light.pdf}
	\caption{
	An example of time-to-event data. Two subjects are followed from time 0. Subject 1 experiences the even at time 100. Subject 2 experiences the event at time 150. Subject 1 was at risk of the event for a total of 5 days. Subject 2 was at risk of the event for a total of 25 days.
	}
	\label{CoxExamplePartial}
\end{figure}

If follow-up time is completely unrepresentative of true time at risk, the Cox model will not produce meaningful results. However, if the total time of follow-up is assumed to be, on average, proportional to the total time at risk (e.g., subjects who are followed up for longer can be expected to have been exposed for longer) then the situation illustrated in Figure  \ref{CoxExamplePartial} will be ``averaged out'' and the model may still produce meaningful results.

To investigate the behaviour of the estimates when time of follow-up is not the same as time at risk but is proportional to it, we generated a simulated dataset, based on the following model:

\begin{align*}
\begin{gathered}
T \sim \text{Exponential}(\text{rate} = \lambda) \\
h(t) = \lambda \\
\text{log}\lambda = -3 - 1.5 X \\
X \sim N(2, 2^2)
\end{gathered}
\end{align*}

Where $T$ is the survival time, $h$ is the hazard function and $X$ is the true log-titre measurement.

Maximum time of follow-up was set to 100 days. Each individual was assigned a proportion of the follow-up time they were exposed to the virus (time-at-risk proportion). This proportion was generated from $\text{Beta}(\mu \kappa, (1 - \mu) \kappa)$ where $\mu$ is the expected proportion for the population and $\kappa$ is inversely proportional to the variance of the time-at-risk proportion. Smaller $\kappa$ values result in larger heterogeneity of exposure in the population. An individual's true time-at-risk was 100 (maximum follow-up) times their time-at-risk proportion. When $\mu = 1$, the time-at-risk proportion was always 1 (regardless of $\kappa$) to represent the ideal context of follow-up time being equal to time-at-risk. 

A random number generated for each individual by $\text{Exponential}(\text{rate} = \text{exp}(-3 - 1.5 X_{\text{logtitre}}) )$ represented the time it would take that individual to experience the event (get infected), that is "survival" time. If survival time was greater than time-at-risk, the individual was "not infected" and their follow-up time was 100 (i.e., this was a right-censored observation). If survival time was smaller than time-at-risk, the individual was "infected" and their follow-up time was their survival time divided by their time-at-risk proportion. 

For example, take a subject whose true survival time is 15, and time-at-risk proportion is 0.25. This individual can be at risk for at most 25 days over the 100-day follow-up period. Since their survival time is less than 25, this individual gets infected. Since their time-at-risk proportion is 0.25, we assume that they would have been exposed for 15 days (required for infection) in 60 days of follow-up (because 60 * 0.25 = 15). Thus for this individual $Y=1, t=60$.

Each simulation included 10,000 observations and was run 10,000 times at each of the following values of $\mu$: 0.01, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.9, 1 and at each of the following values of $\kappa$: 0.5, 1, 10, 100, 1000. The Cox proportional hazards model was fit to each simulated dataset. From 10,000 simulations at each combination of values of $\mu$ and $\kappa$, the mean of the estimated coefficient and its standard deviation were saved. The results are summarised in Figure \ref{CoxSimResults}.

In the ideal case ($\mu = 1$) the estimate is unbiased and has the smallest error. As the proportion of time at risk decreases, bias is introduced. More bias is introduced when $\kappa$ is small, i.e. when there is a larger amount of heterogeneity of exposure. When exposure is very similar for all members of the population (large $\kappa$), the model estimate has minimal bias across the range of $\mu$.

\end{figure}

The results in Figure \ref{CoxSimResults} show that the Cox PH model can produce (almost) unbiased estimates when time-at-risk is not the same as time-of-follow-up when two assumptions are satisfied. First is that time-at-risk is proportional to time-of-follow-up. Second is that exposure in the population is not overly heterogeneous, e.g. if subjects are expected to have been exposed for 20\% of their follow-up time then each individual subject was exposed for close to 20\% of their follow-up time (corresponds to simulations at $\kappa = 1000,\ \kappa = 100$) rather than having 20\% of the subjects almost always exposed and 80\% almost never exposed (corresponds to simulations at $\kappa = 0.5,\ \kappa = 1$).

The assumption of time at risk being proportional to time of follow-up is likely to hold when everyone in the sample is followed through a period of similar disease activity. There may still be subjects who are not exposed (or over-exposed), but as long as the level of exposure does not correlate with the covariates of interest (e.g., antibody titres), then with a large enough sample size the average exposure for any covariate pattern (e.g., antibody titre level) should be proportional in the same way to the time of follow-up. If the disease is seasonal, the start of follow-up can be set to the start of the season. For those who do not get infected, end of follow-up can then be the end of the season. For those who do get infected, end of follow-up can be the infection time assuming that infection grants immunity for the rest of the season. An illustration is in Figure \ref{CoxIdeal}.

\begin{figure}[htp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.59\textwidth]{../curve-cox/timeplot_3_light.pdf}
	\caption{
	An illustration of a pattern of follow-up where the assumption of true time at risk being proportional to time of follow-up is likely to hold. The shaded region marks the period of time when the disease is active. Both subject's follow-up starts at the beginning of the disease season (activity). Subject 1 gets infected at 150 days, their follow-up would end there assuming infection grants immunity (their total recorded time of follow-up would be 50 days). Subject 2 does not get infected through the season, their time of follow-up ends at the end of the season (their total recorded time of follow-up would be 100 days).
	}
	\label{CoxIdeal}
\end{figure}

This assumption will likely not hold if, with a seasonal disease, there are people in the sample whose follow-up starts before the season as shown in Figure \ref{CoxNotIdeal}. For those with earlier follow-up start, their follow-up time will be large regardless of their titres (since they spend a proportion of that time not being at risk). This should make it seem like the titres have a smaller effect than they actually do thus biasing the estimate of titre effect towards the null.

\begin{figure}[htp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.59\textwidth]{../curve-cox/timeplot_4_light.pdf}
	\caption{
	An illustration of a pattern of follow-up where the assumption of true time at risk being proportional to time of follow-up is likely to not hold. The shaded region marks the period of time when the disease is active. Subject 1 gets infected at 150 days, at which point their follow-up would end if it can be assumed that infection grants immunity (their total recorded time of follow-up would be 50 days). Subject 2 does not get infected within the season, their follow-up ends at the end of the season (their total recorded time of follow-up would be 100 days). For subjects 3 (recorded follow up of 100 days) and 4 (recorded follow-up of 175 days) follow-up commenced prior to season onset.
	}
	\label{CoxNotIdeal}
\end{figure}

To demonstrate this problem, we performed a simulation study using the same procedure as described above, except a proportion of the subjects were randomly chosen to have their follow-up started earlier. For those randomly chosen, a uniform random number between 0 and 200 (days) was added to their recorded follow-up time. Time-at-risk proportion was always 1. This means that the subjects' follow-up time was equal to their time-at-risk unless they were chosen to have their follow-up started earlier and hence artificially extended.

The bias resulting from varying the proportion of the sample with earlier follow-up is shown in Figure \ref{CoxSimLong}. The estimate is unbiased when follow-up starts at the start of the season for all subjects. Bias towards the null increases rapidly even when only a small (10\%) proportion of the sample has started follow-up prior to the season. For this reason, it would be advisable to record follow-up time in such a way that true unobservable time at risk can be reasonably expected to be proportional to the recorded time of follow-up (i.e., the longer a subject is followed, the longer they are likely to have been at risk).
