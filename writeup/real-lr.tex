The logistic model was applied to both the Kiddivax and the Ha Nam data.

The resulting protection curve for Kiddivax is in Figure \ref{fig:kiddyvaxmain-prot-lr} and for Ha Nam --- in Figure \ref{fig:hanam-prot-lr}. The resulting relative-to-5 protection curve for Kiddivax is in Figure \ref{fig:kiddyvaxmain-prot-rel-lr-boot} and for Ha Nam --- in Figure \ref{fig:hanam-prot-rel-lr-boot}.

While the relative-to-5 protection curves appear more plausible than the relative-to-baseline protection curves, both result from fitting a model with an unsatisfied assumption (baseline of 1) and neither method of generating protection curves from logistic regression model reliably produces accurate results. In addition, the high confidence in the results is misplaced as it is a result of a string assumption on the data that is unfounded.

The relative-to-5 curves present an additional problem. The curve shows how much ``better'' different titres are at protecting against infection than the titre of 5.
There is nothing inherently special about this threshold of 5. Its choice is based on the lower dilution of 10 which is necessitated by the pre-treatment of sera. The curves may look substantially different if a different threshold (e.g. 10 or 1) is chosen. This hampers the interpretability and comparison of results.
